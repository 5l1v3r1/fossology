This projects/ directory is intended for storing project-related
information and notes that are not part of the source code tree.
This directory should NOT be included in release tarballs!

You can use this as an incubator to develop speculative new code.  Once the code
gets approved by the other fossology-developers, it can move to the 
main source tree and distributed with fossology.
