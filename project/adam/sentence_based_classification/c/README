This is the beginnings of a C version of the sentence_based_classification algorithm. Currently the stemmer and tokenizer is working. The sentence trainer and parser are almost completed.

Dependencies:
	libstemmer from http://snowball.tartarus.org/download.php
	libmaxent from http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/lzhang10/maxent_toolkit.html


Applications:
First you want to bruild the sentence model.  Then label_sentences can create more training data for the 
sentence model.

train_sent_model:
	This application takes a set of files as input. Each file should have its sentences wrapped with <SENTENCE>...</SENTENCE> tags. The application outputs a model file called SentenceModel.dat. This model file can be used to label sentence breaks in unlabeled files.

label_sentences:
	This application uses an existing SentenceModel.dat model file to automatically 
    label the sentence breaks in a file. The only argument is a single file to be labelled.
  
    Build the model by:
      train_sent_model {paths to training files}
      This writes SentenceModel.dat
  
    eg.    train_sent_model ../../Training/Sentences/*.sent
      
    Run:  ./label_sentences {filename}
    output goes stdout

   label_senetences uses a maxent model to automatically label a file with <SENTENCE></SENTENCE> tags.
   After this, you should manually check the file and adjust tags as needed.  At least you might want
   to do this until you have confidence that the model doesn't need tweaking.
