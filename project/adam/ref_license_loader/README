loader.c is used to take a list of reference license with .meta files and load them into the fossology database. The loader application takes a file containing the paths to the reference license .meta files on each line. The .meta files are located first and then used to create an entry in the database. The reference license is then loaded into the database. A minimal .meta file is simply an empty file named 'License_name".meta.

if the second argument is 'test' ( without quotes ) then loader.c will not populate the database. This is helpful when checking the formatting of the .meta files.

DOTO: 
	1) The database information is currently hard coded. This should be magiced into the Makefile.
	3) Document code!
	4) A getopt and usage code.

META format:
	For a license X there should be an accompanying X.meta file. This second file holds the information about license X such as its name and its originating url.
	The .meta files use a 'key: value' on each line. The following are keys that loader recognizes. 

	Date: The date that the license was added. This should be in YYYY-MM-DD format. Defaults to NULL.
	URL: The source url. Defaults to NULL.
	shortname: The shortened name or abbreviated name. For example General Public License would have the shortname GPL. REQUIRED. Currently defaults to the license filename.
	fullname: The full name of the given license. Defaults to NULL.
	OSIapproved: A boolean field which accepts Yes(1), No(0), True(1), or False(0). Defaults to NULL.
	FSFfree: A boolean field which accepts Yes(1), No(0), True(1), or False(0). Defaults to NULL.
	GPLv2compatible: A boolean field which accepts Yes(1), No(0), True(1), or False(0). Defaults to NULL.
	GPLv3compatible: A boolean field which accepts Yes(1), No(0), True(1), or False(0). Defaults to NULL.
	copyleft: A boolean field which accepts Yes(1), No(0), True(1), or False(0). Defaults to NULL.
	Fedora: A string field. Defaults to NULL.
	notes: A string field. Defaults to NULL.
