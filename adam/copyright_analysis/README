prototype.py: 
    takes a list of training files, i.e. `find data/*.label > trainingdata`,
    and a file to be analyzed.

    The copyright holders are output on a lines with the following format:
        ... token_{-2} token_{-1} * copyright holder

    Example:
        $ find data/*.label > trainingdata
        $ ./prototype.py trainingdata /usr/share/doc/apache2/copyright

    TODO:
        * Currently the byte offsets get mangled when extracting the emails and
        urls. Once this is resolved the byte offsets of the copyright holders
        can be returned.
        * Convert into C.
