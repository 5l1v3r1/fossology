The main script for sentence based license classification is f1.py. Its has two functions. First to create a database of labeled sentences. Secondly the script uses the database to label unlabeled license.

Note: The PYTHONPATH environment variable needs to contain the path to utils/parser.py, utils/maxent_utils.py, and sparsevect/python/ to function correctly.

Usage:
	f1.py [-S sentence_model] [-D database] [-T template_file] [-o output_dir] [-f test_files]
	-S, --sentence_model: path of the sentence model file
	-D, --database: If the -T flag is specified then a database cache file will be saved at the location specified. Otherwise, loads a pre-cached database model.
	-T, --templates: Path to a \\n delineated file with paths to license template files.
	-o, --output: Output directory
	-f, --files: Path to a \\n delineated file with paths to test files
	-d, --debug: Turn debug output on

Example: (assume that a sentence model exists at ../models/SentenceModel.dat)
	export PYTHONPATH := ../utils:../sparsevect/python:../sentence_based_classification
	find ../Licenses/ -type f -not \( -regex ".*meta$$" \)  -not \( -wholename "*.svn*" \) > templates.txt

	python f1.py -d -S ../models/SentenceModel.dat -D ../models/Database.dat -T templates.txt
	python f1.py -S ../models/SentenceModel.dat -D ../models/Database.dat -f tests.txt -o output
