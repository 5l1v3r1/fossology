This is the beginnings of a C version of the sentence_based_classification algorithm. Currently the stemmer and tokenizer is working. The sentence trainer and parser are almost completed.

Dependencies:
	libstemmer from http://snowball.tartarus.org/download.php
	libmaxent from http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/lzhang10/maxent_toolkit.html


Applications:

train_sent_model:
	This application takes a set of files as input. Each file should have its sentences wrapped with <SENTENCE>...</SENTENCE> tags. The application outputs a model file called SentenceModel.dat. This model file can be used to label sentence breaks in unlabeled files.

label_sentences:
	This application uses an existing SentenceModel.dat model file to automatically label the sentence breaks in a file. The only argument is a single file to be labelled.
