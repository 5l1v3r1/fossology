FOSSology hacking
=================
The fossology build uses make variables for most things and variables are
inherited down the hierarchy. By setting variables on the make command
line you can easily change things in the build

CFLAGS:
The default CFLAGS for all C compilation is "-g -O2 -Wall". Let's say
you wanted to build the whole tree with debugging and warnings but
without optimization. You could do that with

  $ make clean; make CFLAGS=-g -Wall

or just in a particular subdir and everything below it

  $ cd devel; make clean; make CFLAGS=-g -Wall

Or maybe you want to build the scheduler using electricfence

  $ cd scheduler; make clean; make CFLAGS=-lefence


Installation location:
All installation locations are controlled by variables as well. Let's say
you wanted to do a test install into a directory pseudoroot rather than
on the system itself

  $ make; mkdir /tmp/foo; make DESTDIR=/tmp/foo install

If you are someone packaging for a distribution you want to use the paths
defined by the FHS for distributions, and install to a pseudoroot so you
can run your packaging results.

 $ make SYSCONFDIR=/etc; mkdir /tmp/foo; make DESTDIR=/tmp/foo \
        PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc LOCALSTATEDIR=/var/

Note: SYSCONFDIR needs to be set during the build as the location of the
configuration files is embedded in the binaries. But none of the other
variables should need to be set at build time, only at install time.
