The following is most of the code for the distro comparison tool talked about on 
http://fossology.org/task:integrate_distrodb_distro_package_reports

Not all the code is here because some internal HP stuff (irrelevant to fossology) was 
removed.  It was mostly standard web metadata, webpage links, formatting, etc.
